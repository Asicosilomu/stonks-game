### UPDATE: I just now realized that if you play for the first time (clean save) the game will get stuck in an infinite loading. In order to get past that, you need to reinitialize your save, by clicking the ERASE ALL DATA button at the bottom and confirming.

A simple game I made in HTML and JavaScript. Your data is saved in LocalStorage!

Basically you wait for prices to go up then sell ya shit

prices randomized every 10sec

can be changed if you make a custom version

If you want to edit this, download the source and edit the variables at the top. Don't go anywhere else unless you know what you're doing.
